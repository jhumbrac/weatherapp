# weather app

Rendered page: https://jhumbrac.github.io/weatherapp

In this assignment I created a weather app that allows me to see both current and five day forecasts using the OpeanWeather api. Recent searches are saved in local storage for faster recall. 5 day forecasts are plotted via Plotly. Openweather icons have been replaced with animated svgs.
